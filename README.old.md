# checkpiont_redux

*this project is one of the last of my training on React (checkpoint on Redux: library to simplify state management)
*it's a todo list app to show tasks first by default
*the user can then filter this list to see those that have already been made or not
*he can add other tasks if he wants and filter the new list obtained
*he can also modify the information of a task already entered
